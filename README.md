# Legal Dream Team

Welcome to my "Legal Dream Team" project! 🤖💼

## About

This is an OpenAI project that uses web scraping with [Puppeteer](https://pptr.dev/) to extract and save structured data from the [Illinois General Assembly website](https://www.ilga.gov/legislation/ilcs/ilcs.asp). This will in turn be used to create embeddings and saved to ChromaDB. Because who needs sleep when you can be normalizing the text of your state's entire library of public acts so you can use it to train our future overlords, amiright? 😄

Next on the agenda is scraping [higher court opinions](https://www.illinoiscourts.gov/top-level-opinions/) which come in PDF format, so I guess I'll be normalizing a whole bunch of PDFs after I get them all downloaded.

## Ask Me Anything

Have any questions about the project? Fire away! Curious about the legal world or the intricacies of web scraping? Feel free to ask me anything! I don't know very much, but I'm learning a lot, and I love to share my knowledge and have a good laugh along the way.

## Contributions

If you're interested in joining the Legal Dream Team, I welcome contributions! Whether you're a legal expert, AI enthusiast, or just someone who loves a good coding challenge, let's collaborate and make this project even more awesome.
